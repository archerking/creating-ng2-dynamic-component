# Dynamic Way of Creating and Destroying Components in Angular 2

In this sample app am trying to demonstrate how we can programmatically create and destroy components using `ViewContainerRef` and `ComponentFactoryResolver` into `ng-content`.

##Setup:

Pull source code from Git and go into the folder containing `package.json` and run command `npm install`. Am assuming `npm` is installed. It will import all the dependencies in `node_modules` folder.

##Running Application

Once all the packages are downloaded, run command `npm start` and you are done. You can access the application by visiting `http://localhost:4200/`.
